A project written in Stata in 2012 in collaboration with two other students of the University of Lausanne.

Personally, I was in charge of writing the Stata code. The econometric analysis performed was a team effort.

The aim of this paper is to assess the effects of marriage situation on post-retirement depression levels. Specifically, the study aims to check if the marriage situation could impact the transition to retirement, the hypothesis being that being married helps overcome issues faced by people going to retirement. To perform our analysis, we use a multinomial response model and more precisely an ordered response model. Since the variable “life satisfaction”, which was our first choice of variable, is only present in wave 1 we attempt to proxy for it using the self reported depression level of the respondents. The idea is to keep in our sample only individuals who got retired sometime between the two waves. 

Literature on the effect of retirement on welfare is rich: in societies where people tend to live longer, the legal age of retirement gets lower. Dave, Rashad and Spasojevic (2006) explain that enacting policies that prolong the retirement age may be desirable (ceteris paribus) and Szinovacz and Davey (2004) find that depressive symptoms increase for women post-retirement.

Hence if retirement can be a good thing for people, their situation seems also to be important. The contribution of our paper consists in studying one of the situations that might help people to enjoy their after work life, namely their marriage situation.
